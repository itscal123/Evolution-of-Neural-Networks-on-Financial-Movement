#  UCI Honors Thesis Project

The renewed interest in artifical intelligence has sparked a rise in applying deep learning techniques (i.e., neural networks) to many fields of research, especially in finance. In fact, the use of machine learning (a superset of deep learning) has begun to grow in popularity in many areas of econometrics with high degrees of success. Additionally, the onset of deep learning has renewed interests in older forms of optimization techniques, such as genetic algorithms. Consequently, there is extensive research on applying such optimization techniques to automate the deep learning framework. Previous use of machine learning in econometrics have been created by model architects which are exclusively designed by hand. In this project, I incorporate ideas from automated model selection via Tournament Selection (a type of genetic algorithm) to discover an optimal neural network architecture under a portfolio management setting
